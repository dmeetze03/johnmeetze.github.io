<h1 class="navy">John Meetze</h1>
<p class="gray">Hello.  My name is John Meetze and I am a senior attending Erskine College. I am from Chapin South Carolina and love math and singing in choirs.  I have two younger brothers.  One is a freshman in college and the other is in 5th grade.</p>
<section>
<p class="black">My favorite hobby that I do is singing.  I am a tenor meaning that I sing higher notes than most other men in choirs.  I love singing in my church choir, but we have just started a new church so right now we are looking for a new choral director and I am the one leading the hymms for the church.  I also sing in my college choir.  We do lots of different varieties of music genres.  I love the atmosphere and personalities of the choir as a whole.</p>
